# HC-Resident Podcast

Android app for listening to more than 350 different Hern√°n Cattaneo Resident sessions. House and Deep House music, soooo recommend it for working, training/working-outs, running (120bpm), etc. It runs as a service, and requires internet connection, only. 

You can get the apk here: https://github.com/Lucho-A/HC-Resident-Podcast/tree/master/app/release
